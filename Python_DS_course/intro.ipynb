    "a_list = [1, 'a', 2.3, 'b']\n",

    "- The `for` loop allows us to go through the list (`a_list`) one item at a time.  The indented code (lines 3-8) is run *each time* through the loop.\n",
    "  Since our list contained six items, the loop is run six times.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- We also showed a \"conditional\" statement (the `if...else`).  This allows us to take different actions depending on whether a condition is met.  For instance, if a gene is upregulated, we might take an action.  Otherwise, we might do something else.  Note that the code to be executed is indented further.  These conditional statements can be as complex as you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We used the \"modulo\" operator (`%`) to get a division \"remainder\".  For example, `8 % 3` evaluates to 2.  This is because the *quotient* of 8 divided by 3 is 2, with a remainder of 2.  Similarly, `7 % 2` evaluates to 1 since the quotient is 3 with a remainder of 1.  The pattern of `x % 2 == 0` is a very common programming idiom for testing whether an integer is even or odd.  \n",

    "    - The double equals `==` tests whether the items are equivlant. i.e. x==y can be read as \"is x equal to y?\"\n",

    "    \n",

By using `str(x)` we were able to express the integer (e.g. 5) as a \"string\" (e.g. \"5\").  This allowed us to then \"sum/add\" it to another string/word.  Otherwise, Python gets confused...how can it \"sum\" an integer and a word?  It knows how to \"sum\" two strings just by putting them next to each other.  For example, `y=\"ABC\" + \"def\"` gives `y=\"ABCdef\"`.\n",
