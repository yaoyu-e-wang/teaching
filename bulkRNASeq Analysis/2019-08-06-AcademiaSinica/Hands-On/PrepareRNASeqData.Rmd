```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)


```

This R markdown reads in data file and package into a R data object and save it.


```{r load, echo=TRUE}
count_data=read.table("DemoData/demo_raw_counts.tsv", 
                      header=TRUE, row.names='Gene')

save(count_data, file="RNASeqData.Rdata")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
